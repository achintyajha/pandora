# DYNOTE

Dynote is a fast and lightweight note taking tool written in TypeScript. It is built for everyone- from developers to someone with no code experience. Rather than typing markdown in your code-editor, Dynote allows you to do it in the Browser, while in development.

## Setup

- Forking this repository makes it much easier. However, incase you want to start from cloning, follow along-

- Clone this repository.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/achintyajha/dynote.git dynote-notes
```

- Install all dependencies

```shell
    cd dynote-notes
    npm i
```

- Setup a cloud-based heroku postgres server.

Follow this guide: <https://dev.to/prisma/how-to-setup-a-free-postgresql-database-on-heroku-1dc1>

Add the database URL to your .env file. (Rename .env.example to .env)

- Push changes to the database

```shell
    npx prisma db push
```

- Start the development server

```shell
    npm run dev
```

Great! This was just a one-time setup. Now you can start writing from the 'New Post' option.

Now create a new github repository and add it as a remote repository to this project. Once you push the changes, deployment is easy with vercel.

## Deployment

- Login to Vercel and create a new project with your github repository. Add the Database URL (that you added in the .env file) to the vercel environment variables. That's it, your project is now available online!

## Configuration

For configuration, you can change the name and description on the home page through the `config.json` file.
Additionally, you can add your social links, toggle the theme from the default light to dark theme. You can also change link colors. This project has started very recently and more config options will be out soon.
